# K-Means Clustering in Hadoop and Spark

This application is an implementation of the famous K-Means Clustering algorithm in Hadoop and Spark. It ran on a cluster of 4 nodes provided during the Cloud Computing course at the University of Pisa.

The two implementations were tested on a large dataset of multi-dimensional points and the results were compared. For more details, see the documentation pdf.
